# Are Electric Vehicles Really Environmentally Friendly?

Electric vehicles (EVs) are often considered environmentally friendly. But are they truly green when we consider CO2 emissions, electricity sources, and lithium production? This project explores some datasets to answer this question.  

Note: This project was developed as the final project of my Data Analytics Bootcamp. It demonstrates the end-to-end process of working with real-world data, from collection and cleaning to analysis and visualization

## Tools & Methods

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, BeautifulSoup, requests)
- Tableau 
- Web Scraping 

## Datasets 

1. Real-world CO emissions from new cars (2022)

## Results

- EVs perform much better in countries with cleaner energy sources.
- In the long term, EVs are genuinely beneficial for the environment during use.
- Environmental risks from battery disposal still exist.
- Investment in renewable energy and Battery production methods is essential to unlock the full potential of EVs
- Improvement in infrastructure, such as widespread charging stations, is critically important (Maximum electric usage of phev:  35%)
